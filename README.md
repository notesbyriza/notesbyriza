# Hi there! Riza's here ðŸ‘‹

I'm _a final-year undergraduate mathematics student_ who is highly interested and curious about the **data field**, **machine learning**, and **digital things**. I enjoy writing so much, this is one of the ways that I like the most to communicate with myself and other people.

Well, it's not my first account. If you don't mind connecting with me on my main account, you can reach me through [this account](https://www.github.com/rizaisnakhoir/). I use this as a medium to make notes about the things I'm currently studying. **Jiayou!**

# Hi there! Riza's here 👋

Throughout my college years in math, my enthusiasm for the **data field** has steadily increased, and that passion continues today. I'm deeply intrigued by the art of **data storytelling** and determined to get better at both analyzing data and communicating its insights effectively. Also, I enjoy **writing** so much! I find this to be one of my favorite means of self-expression and communication with others.

Actually, I use this account as a platform for taking notes on what I'm currently studying and more. I'm open to opportunities for mutual sharing and learning together 🤝 

**Jiayou!**
